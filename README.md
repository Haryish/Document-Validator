# Document-Validator

From my work experience as a manual tester, it is tough for me to work on executing test cases which requires document validation with the templated document / Email content and time validation with the usual template... so we need to create the tool that enables testers can upload the template or copy or paste the content from the sample document to the application, along with the document that was arrived during testing., once after uploading and confirmation, they should get generated with Analysis of both the documents and descripancies found in the content.

This report can be downloaded attached in the test evidence document so that others can access this.
